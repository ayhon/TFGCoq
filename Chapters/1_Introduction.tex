{Ethereum, taken as a whole, can be viewed as a transaction-based state machine: we begin with a genesis state and incrementally execute transactions to morph it into some current state. It is this current state which we accept as the canonical “version” of the world of Ethereum.}
{Ethereum Yellow Paper}

\section{Motivation}
\label{sect:motivation}

% A distinctive feature of Ethereum is that transactions are programs, smart contracts, and computing a state transition requires to run the contract code to compute the next state. This capability
% is provided by the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) that can execute programs written in EVM
% bytecode.


%% Why EVM good for optimization %% 
In the field of code optimization, EVM bytecode stands as a language with much to benefit from, as it
has some unique requirements which open up new dimensions for optimization. For general purpose
programming languages the optimization's focus are usually on execution time, memory usage or code size.
However, in the case of programs compiled to EVM bytecode, called \emph{smart contracts}, one must also
take into consideration other factors, such as the size of the compiled binary or the cost of the
programs execution. Every EVM instruction requires a fee (called \emph{gas}\footnote{See 
\url{https://www.evm.codes/}}) to be paid for its execution, and these prices can vary greatly in 
magnitude.

%% WHY EVM code optimization not widespread %%
However, the optimization of EVM bytecode is not as widespread as one could imagine. This is in part
due to the higher stakes that EVM programs, called \emph{smart contracts}, tend to work under. A bug
in a \emph{smart contract} tends to have a greater impact than most other programs, often resulting
in large monetary loses\footnote{See \url{https://www.gemini.com/cryptopedia/the-dao-hack-makerdao}}.
It is therefore understandable that \emph{smart contract} developers do not want to risk
being responsible of the semantics of their code being contaminated by a third party's tool.

%% FORVES verifier %%
To mitigate this risk, the \verb|FORVES|
\footnote{FORmaly Verified EVM optimizationS \url{https://github.com/costa-group/forves2/}}
project aims to develop a verifier which is able to guarantee that an optimization of a jump-free
sequence of EVM instructions (that is, without pieces of code that are conditionally executed)
retains the same semantics as the original unoptimized version. \verb|FORVES| works by computing the 
resulting state after the execution of both sequences and applying simplifying them to prove their
equivalence.
This, however, does not by itself suffice to appease the worries of the \emph{smart contract} 
developer, since we have merely pushed the burden of trust from the optimizer to the verifier. If the 
verifier were to have a bug, it could fail to recognize a valid optimization or, in the worst case, 
guarantee that an erroneous optimization is in fact valid, impacting its users.

%% WHY trust FORVES -> Coq %%
The solution is to, again, shift the burden of proof to another tool. For the \verb|FORVES| project the 
verifier has been written in Coq, a proof assistant and programming language which allows its users to 
define a formal specification and prove that their program adheres to it. The benefit of using a tool
such as Coq is that the burden of proof is placed on a small core subset of its features, which have
been deeply scrutinized by mathematicians, and out of which all the other functionalities are built.
Therefore, to trust that a Coq-certified program is correct is equivalent to trusting that the Coq  
kernel is correct, which is a much greater assurance. 
% TODO: add link to article on verifying Coq in Coq: https://www.openaccessgovernment.org/proof-assistants-2/80852/
Many different projects have taken advantage of this fact to develop pieces of critical software which
can be trusted upon \cite{ConCert,FiatCryptoSP19,CompCert,Iris,Cosette}. A brief description of these projects can be found in Chapter 
    \ref{cap:state-of-the-art}.
% TODO: add references to other tools verified in Coq

%% WHY trust FORVES -> Coq %%
The purpose of this project is to aid in the development of \verb|FORVES2|, a successor of \verb|FORVES|
which improves on its reasoning power by allowing it to take into account contextual information to
decide if two pieces of code are equivalent. The jump-free sequences of instructions which \verb|FORVES|
takes as input are usually extracted from a complete program, which offers additional information about
how it is used and what kind of values it receives. In particular, to apply some optimizations it is
necessary to be able to derive certain constraints from this contextual information. Consider the 
following example.

\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}[auto,
  node distance = 12mm and 20mm,
  start chain = going below,
  box/.style = {draw,rounded corners,blur shadow,fill=white,
        on chain,align=center}]
 \node[box] (b2)    {\verb|x0|\mintinline{haskell}{ = ...} \\ \verb|x1|\mintinline{haskell}{ = ...} \\ \verb|x0| - \verb|x1| $\ge$ 128?};      
 \node[box] (b3)    {\mintinline{haskell}{MEM[x0] = ...} \\ \mintinline{haskell}{MEM[x1] = ...}};  
 \node[box,right=of b2] (b4)    {\dots};     
 \begin{scope}[rounded corners,-latex]
 \path 
  (b2) edge node{\color{red}{\texttt{false}}} (b4)
  (b2) edge node{\mintinline{coq}{true}} (b3);
 \end{scope}
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

The third block is only reachable if the jump condition is met, which means that \verb|x0| $\ge$ 
\verb|x1| $+ 128$. This information can be useful when optimizing a piece of code, and must therefore
be taken into consideration when certifying that two sequences of instructions are semantically 
equivalent. 

The contextual information which \verb|FORVES2| is interested in are constraints of the form 
$x + d \le y + d'$ where $x$ and $y$ represent variables which point to EVM values (which themselves
are a subset of the integers) and $d$ and $d'$ are integer constants. In particular from the previous
constraints we can also derive the constraints of the form $x \ge y$, $x = d$ or $x < y + d'$ by taking
advantage of the symmetry of the order relation, the combination of multiple constraints or the fact
that $x \le k$ for $x$ and $k$ integers implies that $x < k + 1$. 

\input{Content/optimization_example}

Therefore, this project aims to develop a constraint solver which is able to prove that a given
constraint holds for a given context. To do so, we transform the constraints into octagonal constraints
and we employ the tightened transitive closure algorithm to finally check if a constraint can be derived
from it.

\section{Objectives}
\label{sect:objectives}

As previously stated, the main objective of this project is to aid in the development of \verb|FORVES2|
by using contextual information to enable the usage of certain simplifications which require of certain
constraints to hold true to be applied. To do so, we set the following sub-objectives:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Implement an implication checker which is able to determine whether a constraint can be derived from a set of contextual information.
    \item Verify the implication checker in Coq.
\end{itemize}

\section{Work plan}
\label{sect:work-plan}

In order to achieve the previous objectives, the following plan was developed.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Define what contextual information is useful for the verifier.
    \item Define the specification of an implementation checker.
    \item Develop and certify a basic implementation checker.
    \item Develop and certify a more complex implementation checker.
\end{itemize}

The project is developed in \verb|FORVES2|'s GitHub repository
\footnote{\url{https://github.com/costa-group/forves2}}, where the modified files are
\verb|constraints.v| and \verb|octagon.v|.
