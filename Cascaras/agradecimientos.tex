\chapter*{Acknowledgements}
To the authors of Logical Foundations \cite{Pierce2017Logical} for the magnificent resource they have made freely
available to the world. I owe them all my knowledge of Coq. To Johannes Hostert, Ike Mulder, Théo Winterhalter,
Meven Lennon-Bertrand, Pierre-Marie Pédrot, Pierre Roux and Kenji Maillard, for their time and help when I asked 
questions in Coq's Zulip chat. And finally, to my thesis directors Samir Genaim and Enrique Martin-Martin for 
helping me through the process of writing my first academic paper.
