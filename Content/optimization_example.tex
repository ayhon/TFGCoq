Consider the following two programs.

\begin{listing}[!ht]
\begin{minted}{haskell}
SWAP3 SWAP1 SWAP2 MSTORE SWAP1 SWAP2 ADD SWAP1 MSTORE
\end{minted}
\caption{Original EVM program}
\label{lst:evm-original}
\end{listing}

\begin{listing}[!ht]
\begin{minted}{haskell}
MSTORE MSTORE POP 
\end{minted}
\caption{Optimized EVM program}
\label{lst:evm-optimized}
\end{listing}

Even though we refer to them as ``Original'' and ``Optimized'', at first glance these two programs don't
appear to be equivalent. Consider the execution of the first program (\ref{lst:evm-original}).

\begin{minted}{haskell}
[x0,x1,x2,x3,x4,x5]
SWAP3    -- Exchange 0th with 3rd element
[x3,x1,x2,x0,x4,x5]
SWAP1    -- Exchange 0th with 1st element
[x1,x3,x2,x0,x4,x5]
SWAP2    -- Exchange 0th with 2nd element
[x2,x3,x1,x0,x4,x5]
MSTORE   -- Store 1st element at 0th element's offset
[x1,x0,x4,x5] -> MEM[x2] = x3
SWAP1
[x0,x1,x4,x5]
SWAP2
[x4,x1,x0,x5]
ADD      -- Exchange first 2 elements with their sum
[x4+x1,x0,x5]
SWAP1
[x0,x4+x1,x5]
MSTORE
[x5] -> MEM[x0] = x4+x1
\end{minted}

Finally, consider the execution of the second program (\ref{lst:evm-optimized})

\begin{minted}{haskell}
[x0,x1,x2,x3,x4,x5]
MSTORE
[x2,x3,x4,x5] -> MEM[x0] = x1
MSTORE
[x4,x5] -> MEM[x2] = x3
POP     -- Discard 0th element
[x5] 
\end{minted}

The effects that these two programs produce are very different. However, they become equivalent
if we have the following pieces of context:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \verb|x4| $=$ \verb|x5|
    \item \verb|x5| $=$ 0
    \item \verb|x0| $\ge$ \verb|x2| $+ 128$
\end{itemize}

The first two ensure that \verb|x4| $+$ \verb|x1| is in fact equivalent to \verb|x1| since from them we
can deduce that \verb|x4| $= 0$. The last one guarantees that the memory accesses to the offsets
referenced by \verb|x0| and \verb|x2| are disjoint, since the word size of the EVM is of 32 bytes (128 
bits), and therefore we can reorder both writes while preserving the semantics of the code. These two
snippets which at first seemed different can be shown to be equivalent if some sort of conditions always
apply.
